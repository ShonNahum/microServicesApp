python3 -m venv venv - יצירת סביבת פייטון לאפליקציה שלי
pip freeze > requirements.txt -  used to create a requirements.txt file that lists all the Python packages and their versions currently installed in your environment.


The command npm init -y is used to quickly create a new package.json file with default values. It automates the initialization process by skipping the interactive prompts, saving you time when setting up a new Node.js project.


venv must be in .dockerignore to build image.. (i use python alpine so no need venv in image..)



Jenkins:
when i run Jenkins to connect it to my project , first of all we need ensure the Jenkins container have SSH access to git@github.com
ssh -T git@github.om
If prompted with a warning (e.g., The authenticity of host 'github.com' can't be established), type yes to add GitHub to the list of known hosts

and have in Jenkins key for my GitHub email
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my@email.com"
And add the public key to GitHub:
Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key.
Paste the key and save it.

----------------------------------------------

- Create in Jenkins Container public and private key..
Give to GitHub the public and the Jenkins credentials the private key & username of GitHub (with all Format Include ssh-rsa and include ---PRIVATEKEY etc..)
And:
Add the SSH private key to the agent:
ssh-add /var/jenkins_home/.ssh/id_rsa

Now
ssh -T git@github.om
will work and not give public key denied

In the Jenkins Pipline i Connected my GitHub so i can take the Jenkinsfiles from there..


Kubernetes:
because i use NodePort, to see it in Public Web: i use:
kubectl get svc --all-namespaces -o wide
kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces

** added init container for DB to create the Table my code needed to work **
